#The data in Table 3.1 are taken from those which were reported in
#Senn and Auclair (1990, p. 1290). They are measurements of peak expiratory
#flow (PEF), a measure of lung function (National Asthma Education Program,
#1991, pp. 6–9), made on 13 children aged 7 to 14 with moderate or severe
#asthma in a two-treatment two-period cross-over comparing the effects of a
#single inhaled dose of 200 g salbutamol, a well-established bronchodilator,
#and 12 g formoterol, a more recently developed bronchodilator (Faulds
#et al.,1991). The children were randomized to one of two sequence groups. In one
#group they were given a dose of formoterol in the morning and observed for 8 h in
#the clinic. They then travelled home where they or their parents took further
#measurements 10, 11 and 12 h after treatment. (PEF is a measurement which
#patients may record themselves using a simple device.) On a subsequent occasion
#after a wash-out of at least one day they presented at the clinic again and were
#given a single dose of salbutamol. Measurements in the clinic followed as before
#and were again succeeded by measurements at home. For the second sequence
#group, the procedure was as for the first except that they received salbutamol on
#the first visit to the clinic and formoterol on the second visit to the clinic.
